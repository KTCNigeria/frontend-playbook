# <p align="center">Frontend Web Development Roadmap</p>

## Phase One: Learning

<details>
<summary>Basic</summary>

## 1. Get familiar with an editor (Visual Studio Code Recommended)

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

  Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes.

### Installation on Windows

  1. Download the [Visual Studio Code Installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=win) for windows.
  2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer `VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe`. This will only take a minute.  
  3. By default, VS Code is installed under `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code`.

  Make sure to restart your console after the installation as setup will add Visual Studio Code to your `%PATH%`, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder. 
  This is so that the `%PATH%` environmental variable can take effect.
  **Alternatively you can also download a [Zip Archive](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=winzip), extract it and run the code from there.**

### Installation on macOS

  1. [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=osx) for macOS.
  2. Open the browser's download list and locate the downloaded app or archive.
  3. If archive, extract the archive contents. Use double-click for some browsers or select the 'magnifying glass' icon with Safari.
  4. Drag `Visual Studio Code.app` to the **Applications** folder, making it available in the macOS Launchpad.
  5. Open VS Code from the **Applications** folder, by double clicking the icon.
  6. Add VS Code to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon, located in the Dock, to bring up the context menu and choosing **Options, Keep in Dock**.

  **Launching from the command line**.

  -Launch VS Code.
  -Open the Command Palette `Cmd+Shift+P` and type 'shell command' to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.

  -Restart the terminal for the new `$PATH` value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

  **Note:** If you still have the old `code` alias in your `.bash_profile `(or equivalent) from an early VS Code version, remove it and replace it by executing the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command. 

### Installation on Linux

  See the [Download Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Code page for a complete list of available installation options.

#### Debian and Ubuntu based distributions
  
  The easiest way to install Visual Studio Code for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions is to download and install the [.deb package (64-bit)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868), either through the graphical software center if it's available, or through the command line with:
  
  ```
    sudo apt install ./<file>.deb

    # If you're on an older Linux distribution, you will need to run this instead:
    # sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb
    # sudo apt-get install -f # Install dependencies
  ```

  Note that other binaries are also available on the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

  Installing the .deb package will prompt to install the apt repository and signing key to enable auto-updating using the system's package manager. To automatically install the apt repository and signing key, such as on a non-interactive terminal, run the following command first:

  ``` 
    echo "code code/add-microsoft-repo boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections
  ```

  The apt repository and key can also be installed manually with the following script:

  ```
    sudo apt-get install wget gpg
    wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
    sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" |sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list > /dev/null
    rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg

  ```

  Then update the package cache and install the package using:
  ```
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install code # or code-insiders

  ```
